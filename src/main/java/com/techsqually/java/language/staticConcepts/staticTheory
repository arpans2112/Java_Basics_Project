we can have static method, block and instance variables

Restriction on Method:
1. They can only directly call other static method
2. They can only directly access static variables of the class
3. They can't refer to this or super in any way
4. Static method and variables can be accessed by ClassName.variableName/ClassName.methodName
5. check StaticBlock.java class to see the behaviour of static blocks
