    * 1. Must have public static final variable types only , must be initialize
    * 2. So No need to of constructor to initalize the variables
    * 3. access modifier must be public for the interfaces, so that can be access outside the package
    * 4. Variable declared in Interface are BY DEFAULT  (public  static final) , they can't be changed
    * 5. members(variable/methods) are default public in interface, you don't need to explicitly define them
    * 6. due to point 5, interface method can be access accross different packages too
    * 7. A Class can extend only one class but can implement nultiple interfaces
      8. An abstract class implementing any interface doesn't mean to implement all interface method
      9. Interface without any method, can be used to shared constants across multiple programs
      10. One interface can extends another interface like a class, But the class implementing the subInterface
          must implement all the methods of subInterface and it's all sub superInterfaces.
      11. jdk -8 includes default and static method in interface
      12  default method will have default implementation and are not mandatory to be implemented by a
          class implementing interface
      13. default method feature added in the interface for two reason
           i.) Gives flexibility to add new features in existing interface, without breaking the existing
               class code, as implementation of default method is optional
           ii.) The optional default method gives flexibility of having optional feature in a single interface
                for example a remove method is there in interface not to be implemented for immutable class
      14  static method in the Interface can be accessed by InterfaceName.methodName
      15. static interface method are not inheritated by either an implementing class or a subInterface
      16. interface can't have instance variables those are not final
      17. private interface method in/after JDK-9. This gives flexibility to have a resubility code can be used
          across mulitple default methods.
