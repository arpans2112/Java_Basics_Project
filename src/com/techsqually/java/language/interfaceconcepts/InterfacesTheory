    /*
    * 1. Must have public static final variable types only , must be initialize
    * 2. So No need to of constructor to initalize the variables
    * 3. access modifier must be public for the interfaces, so that can be access outside the package
    * 4. Variable declared in Interface are BY DEFAULT  (public  static final) , they can't be changed
    * 5. members(variable/methods) are default public in interface, you don't need to explicitly define them
    * 6. due to point 5, interface method can be access accross different packages too
    * 7. A Class can extend only one class but can implement nultiple interfaces
